There are also multiple controls and specific features to make your applications good-looking and user-friendly. All the components are objects made with the webix.ui() constructor where the type of the component is set by the 'view' property (the declarative syntax is available as well). <br><br>Layouts help you to organize your web page, define its overall look-and-feel. You can arrange the content in columns and rows, divide it into groups and control through navigation or animation.<br><br>Data components are used to present data of a specified type on the page. Such components manage the space allocated for their data and provide functionality for its access and configuration.<br><br> Context components let displaying spatial and temporal information on some user's action, such as click on a button or filling in a field.<br><br>Html-oriented components supply handy means for using habitual HTML elements in an application. There you can specify HTML templates, inline frames, forms etc.<br><br>Auxiliary components help you to complete the picture of your application, to add special features that can't be achieved with the standard set of components presented above.<br><br> Controls are mainly responsible for handling events since they enable user-app interaction by triggering functions attached to them. Note that any event can be attached to any component by referring to its ID.<br><br>UI extensions are helpful components that are mostly task-oriented and intended to accomplish a certain purpose. They are already quite configurable and need only initializing on the page to start serving.</div>"
