# Java main() Method Explained

## **1. Overview**

Every program needs a place to start its execution; talking about Java programs, that's the main method.

## **2. Common Signature**

```
 public static void main(String[] args) { }
```

- *public* – access modifier, meaning global visibility

- *static* – the method can be accessed straight from the class, we don’t have to instantiate an object to have a reference and use it

- *void* – means that this method doesn't return a value

- *main* – the name of the method, that’s the identifier JVM looks for when executing a Java program

- As for the *args* parameter, it represents the values received by the method. This is how we pass arguments to the program when we first start it.

  `java CommonMainMethodSignature foo bar`

## **3. Different Ways to Write a `main()` Method**

```java
public static void main(String []args) { }
public static void main(String args[]) { }
public static void main(String...args) { }
public strictfp static void main(String[] args) { }
public static void main(final String[] args) { }
final static synchronized strictfp void main(final String[] args) { }
```

## 4. Having More Than One *main()* Methods

*META-INF/MANIFEST.MF* (encoded in UTF-8)

`Main-Class: mypackage.ClassWithMainMethod`

## **5. Conclusion**

This tutorial described the details of the *main* method and some other forms it can assume, even the ones that aren't very common to most of the developers.

Keep in mind that, **although all the examples that we've shown are valid in terms of syntax, they just serve the educational purpose** and most of the time we'll stick with the common signature to do our job.
