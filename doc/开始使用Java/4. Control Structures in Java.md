# Control Structures in Java

## **1. Overview**

In the most basic sense, a program is a list of instructions. **Control structures are programming blocks that can change the path we take through those instructions.**

In this tutorial, we'll explore control structures in Java.

**There are three kinds of control structures:**

- Conditional Branches, which we use **for choosing between two or more paths.** There are three types in Java: *if/else/else if*, *ternary operator* and *switch*.
- Loops that are used to **iterate through multiple values/objects and repeatedly run specific code blocks.** The basic loop types in Java are *for*, *while* and *do while*.
- Branching Statements, which are used to **alter the flow of control in loops.** There are two types in Java: *break* and *continue*.

## 2. If/Else/Else If

```java
if (count > 2) {
    System.out.println("Count is higher than 2");
} else {
    System.out.println("Count is lower or equal than 2");
}
```

## 3. Ternary Operator

`System.out.println(count > 2 ? "Count is higher than 2" : "Count is lower or equal than 2");`

While ternary can be a great way to make our code more readable, it isn't always a good substitute for *if/else.*

## 4. Switch

```java
int count = 3;
switch (count) {
    case 0:
        System.out.println("Count is equal to 0");
        break;
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Count is equal to 1");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Count is either negative, or higher than 1");
        break;
}
```

## 5. Loops

```java
private static void loopsDemo() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
            methodToRepeat();
        }

        int whileCounter = 1;
        while (whileCounter <= 50) {
            methodToRepeat();
            whileCounter++;
        }
    }

    private static void methodToRepeat() {
        log.info("I am tom,Current thread  {}", Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
```



## 6. Break

**We need to use [\*break\*](https://www.baeldung.com/java-continue-and-break) to exit early from a loop.**

```java
private static void breakDemo() {
    List<String> names = getNameList();
    String name = "John Doe";
    int index = 0;
    for ( ; index < names.size(); index++) {
        if (names.get(index).equals(name)) {
            log.info("this list has this guy {}",name);
            break;
        }
    }
}

private static List<String> getNameList() {
    return Arrays.asList("tom","jack","John Doe");
}
```

## 7. Continue

Simply put, [*continue*](https://www.baeldung.com/java-continue-and-break) **means to skip the rest of the loop we're in:**

```java
private static void continueDemo() {
    List<String> names = getNameList();
    String name = "John Doe";
    String list = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
        if (names.get(i).equals(name)) {
            continue;
        }
        list += names.get(i);
    }
    log.info("{}", JSON.toJSONString(list));
}
```

## 8. Conclusion

In this quick article, we learned what control structures are and how to use them to manage flow control in our Java programs.
